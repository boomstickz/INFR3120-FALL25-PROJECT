## Project Description
In this project we created a Dungeons and Dragons character manager. The purpose of this application is to create an interactive fillable character sheet as an alternative to the pen and paper character sheets commonly used by players. Using full CRUD operations users can create new D&D characters, save their characters, view a table of their created characters and edit and delete any created characters. The landing page displays an introduction to our site along with a template of the display table which displays a few but not all of the character’s attributes for easier character management purposes. 

The initial release includes most of the standard character sheet fields but is missing a few to help ensure less errors are encountered during setup. As well as partial CSS styling for the fillable character sheets that roughly resembles standard character sheet layouts. In future releases we hope to have it look like a complete D&D character sheet with aesthetic styling. Additionally, as the project progresses we will add more interactive elements such as automatic calculations.
